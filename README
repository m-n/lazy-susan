More flexible symbol reading by way of a readtable.

This is implemented by creating a new readtable rather than
redifining Common Lisp functions. Because of this, all you
need to do to take advantage of the added flexibility is
(lazy-susan:in-syntax lazy-susan:*flexible-readtable*) at the top
of your files -- you don't have to abandon :USEinging the CL
package.

We intend to make the following easy to implement.

1. Package local package designators
2. Synonym symbols.
3. Redefinition of constituent traits
   (e.g. treat #\: as something other than a package seperator.)

Out of scope:

1. Unordered reading, e.g. foo.bar -> (bar foo)
